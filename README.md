Project Description
The Invisible Maze is a quirky web-based game where users must navigate an unseen maze. As players move, they receive visual and auditory feedback when hitting walls and approach a goal, but the path remains hidden.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Navigating a maze without sight! Imagine a world where mazes are invisible, and players must rely on instincts or subtle feedback to guide them. The lack of a visible path keeps players guessing and offers an amusing test of patience and memory.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an interactive web-based maze where users control their position via buttons or arrow keys, moving through an invisible grid. "Bump" sounds play when hitting walls, and a chime sound increases in volume as they near the goalâ€”though, of course, they canâ€™t see it!
